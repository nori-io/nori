# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the Nori repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Nori's employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Nori holds the copyright.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address>

# Please keep the list sorted.
